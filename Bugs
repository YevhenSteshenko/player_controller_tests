    name:           Add more description for parameters in swagger.
    description:    Need to provide more details for params in Swagger.
                    Example:
                        - Age: missing information about range. Now it's passed in range (17 - 60)
                        - Role: need to add description which Enum value is using here
                        - Gender: need to add description which Enum value is using here
                        - Editor: no description about this entity.




------------------------------------------GET /player/create/{editor}---------------------------------------------------

    name:           GET /player/create/{editor} use GET request instead of POST.
    description:    Better to switch player/create to POST HTTP Request with Body instead of GET with path_params


    name:           GET /player/create/{editor} 400 error instead of 403
    description:    when request sent into GET /player/create/{editor} endpoint with incorrect path params then Backend
                    respond with 400 error code with no information.
    suggestions:    1. Use 403 Forbidden error instead of 400 error which not described on Swagger.
                    2. Add error description into error message instead of empty which is using now for 403 error code.


    name:           GET /player/create/{editor} Password field should be mandatory
    description:    (Ofcourse I didn't see any reqs but when some User-type entity created Password it's an mandatory field)
                    Now when new Player created via GET /player/create/{editor} request field Password could be skipped.
                    Need to mark it as mandatory.


    name:           When player created via GET /player/create/{editor} request Backend returns only "id" and "login" fields

                    return all correct values
                    {
                      "id": 2024912916,
                      "login": "UdZof64264",

                    Expected that all fields will be fill out with sent parameters


    name:           GET /player/create/{editor} gender field should pass only options from Enum.
    description:    Now Backend pass any string value instead of validate it based on Enum options:
                    GET http://3.68.165.45/player/create/supervisor?login=UdZof64264&password=sQVlX69002&screenName=djaAk69214&gender=sjbfsbd&role=user&age=17

                    Need to add correct field validation for this field.


    Critical:
    name:           GET /player/create/{editor} Password field should be mandatory
    description:    (Ofcourse I didn't see any reqs but when some User-type entity created Password it's an mandatory field)

                    Need to mark it as mandatory.


    Critical:
    name:           GET /player/create/{editor} Player updated via Create endpoint.
    description:    (Actually here I'm not sure this is a bug not a feature but behavior kind a strange)
                    Based on Backend logic it Create new Player entity in case when request contains "login" value
                    which is absent in db. But in case when "login" already present in db Backend update other fields
                    instead of show some error message that user with such "login" already exist.
